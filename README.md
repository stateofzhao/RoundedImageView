A fast ImageView (and Drawable) that supports rounded corners (and ovals or circles) based on the original [example from Romain Guy](http://www.curious-creature.org/2012/12/11/android-recipe-1-image-with-rounded-corners/). RoundedImageView is a full superset of [CircleImageView](https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView) (which is actually just a subset based on this lib) with many more advanced features like support for ovals, rounded rectangles, ScaleTypes and TileModes.

There are many ways to create rounded corners in android, but this is the fastest and best one that I know of because it:
* does **not** create a copy of the original bitmap
* does **not** use a clipPath which is not hardware accelerated and not anti-aliased.
* does **not** use setXfermode to clip the bitmap and draw twice to the canvas.

If you know of a better method, let me know (or even better open a pull request)!

Also has proper support for:
* Borders (with Colors and ColorStateLists)
* Ovals and Circles
* All `ScaleType`s
  * Borders are drawn at view edge, not bitmap edge
  * Except on edges where the bitmap is smaller than the view
  * Borders are **not** scaled up/down with the image (correct width and radius are maintained)
* Anti-aliasing
* Transparent backgrounds
* Hardware acceleration
* Support for LayerDrawables (including TransitionDrawables)
* TileModes for repeating drawables


Gradle
----
RoundedImageView is available in [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.makeramen%22%20AND%20a%3A%22roundedimageview%22).

Add the following to your `build.gradle` to use:
```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.makeramen:roundedimageview:2.1.0'
}
```

Usage
----
Define in xml:

```xml
<com.makeramen.roundedimageview.RoundedImageView
        xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
        android:id="@+id/imageView1"
        android:src="@drawable/photo1"
        android:scaleType="fitCenter"
        app:riv_corner_radius="30dip"
        app:riv_border_width="2dip"
        app:riv_border_color="#333333"
        app:riv_mutate_background="true"
        app:riv_tile_mode="repeat"
        app:riv_oval="true" />
```

Or in code:

```java
RoundedImageView riv = new RoundedImageView(context);
riv.setScaleType(ScaleType.CENTER_CROP);
riv.setCornerRadius((float) 10);
riv.setBorderWidth((float) 2);
riv.setBorderColor(Color.DKGRAY);
riv.mutateBackground(true);
riv.setImageDrawable(drawable);
riv.setBackground(backgroundDrawable);
riv.setOval(true);
riv.setTileModeX(Shader.TileMode.REPEAT);
riv.setTileModeY(Shader.TileMode.REPEAT);
```

Or make a Transformation for Picasso:

```java
Transformation transformation = new RoundedTransformationBuilder()
          .borderColor(Color.BLACK)
          .borderWidthDp(3)
          .cornerRadiusDp(30)
          .oval(false)
          .build();

Picasso.with(context)
    .load(url)
    .fit()
    .transform(transformation)
    .into(imageView);
```

ChangeLog
----------
* **2.1.1**
    * Fix for CENTER_CROP bug ([#8](https://github.com/vinc3m1/RoundedImageView/issues/8)) 

* **2.1.0**
    * Add APIs for setting different corner radii. Currently only supports a single radius or 0 (allows you to choose which corners to be rounded by setting otheres to 0).

* **2.0.1**
    * Invalidate after `setCornerRadius()`

* **2.0.0**
    * Package changed from `com.makeramen.*` to `com.makeramen.roundedimageview.*`
    * `setCornerRadius(int resId)` is now `setCornerRadiusDimen(int resId)` for clarity.
    * Logging fix (#81)
    * ColorFilter support (#73)

* **1.5.0**
    * [`Shader.TileMode`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Shader.TileMode.html) support

* **1.4.0**
    * initial ColorDrawable fix for Lollipop(5.0)
    * xml attributes are now namespaced and start with `riv_`
    * renamed methods `mutatesBackground()` and `mutateBackground(bool)`

* **1.3.1**
    * add support for About Libraries ([#57](https://github.com/vinc3m1/RoundedImageView/issues/57))
    * reset matrix for Robolectric support  ([#56](https://github.com/vinc3m1/RoundedImageView/issues/56))

* **1.3.0**
    * A new `RoundedTransformationBuilder` to help build Picasso `Transformation`s
    * slight API changes:
        * all dimensions are now set at `float`s. `int`s will be interpreted as dimension resource IDs
        * `round_background` is now `mutate_background`, and a `RoundedDrawable` will no longer be created for the background if `mutate_background` is false.

* **1.2.4**
    * add basic support for ColorDrawable (and other drawables with -1 intrinsic dimens)
    * implementation of the above is known to be buggy in many cases, pull requests welcome

* **1.2.3**
    * added rudimentary support for `setImageUri`. Performance of the function is probably poor and users should be cautious when using it.

* **1.2.2**
    * fix for incorrect radius on the image when there is a border
    * add a `toBitmap()` function for easier Picasso and Ion compatibility

* **1.2.1**
    * default scaleType now FIT_CENTER (and never null) to match Android ([#27](https://github.com/vinc3m1/RoundedImageView/issues/27))

* **1.2.0**
    * add `setDither` and `setFilterBitmap` method support on RoundedDrawable for tuning bitmap scaling quality
    * improved performance for `setImageResource`
    * RoundedDrawable constructor is now public
    * Fixed bug where artifact was downloading `aar.asc` file instead of aar. You no longer need to have `@aar` specified in the dependency

* **1.1.0**
    * LayerDrawable support (needs testing!)
    * Refactored api to support chaining and remove repetitive code

* **1.0.0**
    * Initial release to maven central
    * Programmatically setting attributes with TransitionDrawables not supported.
